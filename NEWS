smooth v1.4.6 (Release date: 2016-11-01)
==============

Changes:

* New function - sim.ssarima() that allows generating data from any ARIMA with any provided parameters.
* New methods for smooth class: lags, orders and modelType. First two are for ssarima(), ges() and sma(), the last one is for es(), ces() and ets() from "forecast" package.
* Introduced new class for simulation functions, "smooth.sim" and created print and plot methods for them.
* es() now accepts "XXX" as model. This allows excluding multiplicative components from the pool. This does not use branch and bound. So model="ZXZ" will go through all the models with T="N", T="A" and T="Ad".
* Similarly es() can now select the most appropriate non-additive model. This is regulated with: model="YYY".

Minor changes:

* Updated print for "smooth" class for es() and ges(): now we produce a nice vector with names of smoothing parameters.
* simulate.smooth() method update in order to take sim.ssarima() into account.
* AICc now also extracts AICc from ets() of "forecast" package.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed a bug with provided model with damped trend.
* Fixed a bug in pool of models with damped trend ("ZAdZ").


smooth v1.4.5 (Release date: 2016-10-16)
==============

Changes:

* Parameter intervals now accepts type of interval instead of intervalsType.
* Polynomials of ssarima() are now multiplied in C++. Initialisation is now done there as well. This slightly speeds up the estimation and construction of SSARIMA.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed names of returned smoothing parameters by es().


smooth v1.4.4 (Release date: 2016-09-20)
==============

Changes:

* auto.ssarima() function uses now a different algorithm. This allows speeding up order selection process and selecting models closer to the "true" one.
* Some corrections in smooth-Documentation.
* Package will now tell its version when loaded.

Bugfixes:

* Corrected C++ bug that caused problems on Solar OS.


smooth v1.4.3 (Release date: 2016-09-16)
==============

Changes:

* Removed "TFL" as a cost function type and "asymmetric" as intervals type. The functions still accept these parameters, but the parameters are now hidden, because currently they are not ready for wide audience.
* Changed how number of parameters is calculated when initials are provided. They should be counted in. Only backcasting now excludes initials in calculation of number of parameters.
* Prepared vignette for es(), ces(), ssarima(), ges(), sma() and sim.es(). This now includes examples with some comments.
* Uploaded documentation for the package to github (https://github.com/config-i1/smooth/smooth.pdf). This will be published as working paper and will be available via ResearchGate.

Bugfixes:

* Fixed a bug with intervalsType="s" not working for auto functions.
* data provided to auto functions is now checked.


smooth v1.4.2 (Release date: 2016-09-15)
==============

Changes:

* We now use vignettes, explaining how to work with functions and what they return. This is just a start of the work. Vignettes will be updated. There is also a work on documentation for models underlying smooth package. This is currently reviewed and will be available as a working paper soon.
* New function - sma() - Simple Moving Average. It fits one as a state-space model. So, apparantely there is a model underlying simple moving average method...
* Named transitionX and persistenceX are now returned, when using exogenous variables are used with updateX=TRUE. This should simplify the analysis of these matrices.

Bugfixes:

* A fix for plot(es(...)) in case of inclusion of exogenous variables leading to states containing more than 10 columns.
* Warnings are now always printed out for unstable SSARIMA.


smooth v1.4.1 (Release date: 2016-09-09)
==============

Changes:

* We now suggest testthat package and do more extensive tests in order to make sure that everything works as it should.
* Introduced parameters A and B in ces() function.
* Got rid of parameter C in ces() function.

Bugfixes:

* ssarima() could not construct ARIMA(0,1,0) without constant. Fixed that.


smooth v1.4.0 (Release date: 2016-09-08)
==============

Changes:

* Started this NEWS file.
* Fixed a bug with ssarima() not accepting previously estimated models in cases with constant=TRUE.
* Removed NUS and sim.ces. They will return when they are in a better condition.
