This vignette explains how to use functions in 'smooth' package, what they produce, what each field in outputs and what returned values mean. Underlying statistical models are not discussed here, but if you want to know more about them, then there is a document "[Statistical models underlying functions of 'smooth' package for R](https://github.com/config-i1/smooth/blob/master/inst/doc/smooth-Documentation.pdf)".

The package includes the following functions:

1. [es() - Exponential Smoothing](es.html);
2. [ssarima() - State-Space ARIMA](ssarima.html), also known as Several Seasonalities ARIMA;
3. [ces() - Complex Exponential Smoothing](ces.html);
4. [ges() - Generalised Exponential Smoothing](ges.html);
5. [ves() - Vector Exponential Smoothing](ves.html);
6. [sma() - Simple Moving Average in state-space form](sma.html);
7. [sim.es() and simulate() - simulation functions for Exponential Smoothing](simulate.html).
8. `xregExpander()` -- function that creates lags and leads of the provided exogenous variables (either vector or matrix). This thing returns the matrix.
9. `stepwise()` -- the function that implements stepwise based on information criteria and partial correlations. Easier to use and works faster than `step()` from ``stats'' package.

This funcions (except for the last one) return object of class ``smooth'', which uses several methods.

## Methods for the class `smooth`

There are several functions that can be used together with `es()`, `ces()`, `ssarima()` and `ges()` functions. So when a model is saved to some object `ourModel`, these function will do some things. Here's the list of all the available methods with some explanations:

1. `summary(ourModel)` -- function prints brief output with explanation of what was fitted, with what parameters and errors;
2. `fitted(ourModel)` -- fitted values;
3. `forecast(ourModel)` -- point and interval forecasts. This is needed for compatibility with Rob Hyndman's "forecast" package. `forecast(ourModel)` returns object of class `forecastSmooth`;
4. `residuals(ourModel)` -- residuals of constructed model;
5. `AIC(ourModel)`, `BIC(ourModel)` and `AICc(ourModel)` -- information criteria of the constructed model. `AICc()` function is not a standard ``stats'' function and is introduced by ``smooth'';
6. `plot(ourModel)` -- plots states of constructed model. If number of states is higher than 10, then several graphs are produced;
7. `simulate(ourModel)` -- produces data simulated from provided model. Currently only available for ETS via `simulate(es(...))`;
8. `summary(forecast(ourModel))` -- prints point and interval forecasts;
9. `plot(forecast(ourModel))` -- produces graph with actuals, forecast, fitted and intervals using `graphmaker()` function.
10. `logLik(ourModel)` -- returns log-likelihood of the model;
11. `nobs(ourModel)` -- returns number of observations in-sample we had;
12. `nParam(ourModel)` -- number of estimated parameters;
13. `pointLik(ourModel)` -- likelihood values for each separate observation;
14. `sigma(ourModel)` -- variance of the residuals of the model;
15. `lags(ourModel)` -- lags of the model (used with `ssarima()` and `ges()`);
16. `orders(ourModel)` -- orders of the model (can be used with `ssarima()` and `ges()`);
17. `modelType(ourModel)` -- returns the type of the model. Returns something like "MMM" for ETS(MMM). Can be used with `es()`, `ces()` and `ets()`.
18. `coef(ourModel)` -- returns the vector of all the estimated coefficients of the model.
19. `formula(ourModel)` -- returns the formula for the measurement equation. This is just for the information and general understanding what we work with.
